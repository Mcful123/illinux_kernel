bug: 4 mb page wouldn't be in memory. Weird numbers.
time to fix: ~1 hour
notes: Had to modify cr4 to enable this 

bug: the kernel wouldn't boot
time to fix: 3 hours 
notes: Had to redesign a lot of our structs and changed to use a union like the IDT union struct.
    Our guess is the values for the paging were very wonky before making this change.

bug: page fault wouldn't trigger for test case
time to fix: 30 minutes
notes: Had to actually dereference pointer instead of just initializing
